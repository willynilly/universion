# UniVersion

**UniVersion** is a conservative, strict universal version comparator and serializer for Python.

## Design Goals

- Fully conservative equality: versions are considered different if any field differs (release, prerelease, post, dev, local).
- Conservative ordering: refuses ordering if ambiguous or undefined (e.g. differing build/local metadata).
- Supports parsing both PEP 440 and SemVer version strings.
- Provides stable, fully reversible serialization to canonical string representation.
- Fully hashable and safe for use in sets and dictionaries.
- Well-suited for build pipelines, version management tools, conservative deployment systems, and reproducible builds.

## Supported Python Versions

- Python >= 3.11

## Installation

```bash
pip install universion
```

## Example Usage

```python
from universion import UniVersion

v1 = UniVersion.parse("1.2.3a1.post2.dev3+build99")
print(v1.to_canonical_string())  # 1.2.3-a1.post2.dev3+build99

# Full equality semantics
v2 = UniVersion.parse("1.2.3a1.post2.dev3+build99")
assert v1 == v2

# Hashable
versions = {v1, v2}
assert len(versions) == 1

# Ordering (only if metadata matches)
v3 = UniVersion.parse("1.2.4")
assert v1 < v3
```

## Canonical Serialization Format

The canonical format generated by `to_canonical_string()` follows:

```
<release>[-<prerelease>][.post<N>][.dev<N>][+<local>]
```

Example:

- `1.2.3-a1.post2.dev3+build99`
